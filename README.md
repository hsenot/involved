involved
========

This project is a micro-tasking platform that can be deployed for mass participation of students (campus), or of volunteers (non profit) on large, time-consuming tasks that offer little room for automation.

The idea is to provide an architecture of collaboration, and lower the barrier for engagement, to foster participation on shared vision tasks. It also serves to involve different types of people, beyond the traditional core developer circle.


A topic of interest for this project will be to explore which types of tasks can be performed - beyond the traditional categorization and image recognition tasks. 
It is expected that some workflows might be able to support data collection, for instance targetted addition/improvements to OpenStreetMap in general and the energy and buildings infrastructure in particular.

Another topic will be to explore best practices in engaging a population of volunteers.

Another element to explore will be infrastructures that offer redundancy and controls, to minimise individual errors by collective addition, and progress datasets towards low error ratios over time.
